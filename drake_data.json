You think I fuck this good without some practice?\nAnd if it's LOV and you're my MVP\nThen why we talkin' about practice?\nLike you want me to lie\nWhy would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?\nConfessions that I blame on the zodiac sign\n'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini\nMight be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives\nJealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys\nAnd if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time\n'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wife",
